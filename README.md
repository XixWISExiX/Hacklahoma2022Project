# Hacklahoma2022Project
This was a project which me and two other people made at the university of oklahoma
2022 hackathon and its official name is called chicken clinic application
## About the app
This is an android application for clinics to register information about their clients
for example the person would sign up and then enter their information. Afterwards they
would look at their profile and then what drugs they need to take for that day in a 
calender like format which lists the drugs effects along with the list of drugs which
you need to take that day.
